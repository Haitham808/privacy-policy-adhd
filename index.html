    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 30, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our app, <strong>ADHD Planner for Adults</strong>, is designed with privacy in mind. Your <strong>Brain Dump</strong> and <strong>Focus Screen</strong> data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage subscriptions. RevenueCat receives anonymized transaction data to verify your $7.99 monthly or Lifetime Pro purchase. They do not have access to your tasks or notes.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Because we do not store your personal task data on our own servers, you have full control over your data. You can delete your data at any time by deleting the app or clearing your iCloud storage.</p>

    <h2>4. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, contact us at: haitham.it80@gmail.com</p>
